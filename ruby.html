      <h1>Ruby/Rails</h1>
      <h2>Ruby</h2>
      <p>Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.</p>
      <h2>Rails</h2>
      <p>Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language.Rails is a framework for building websites. As such, Rails establishes conventions for easier collaboration and maintenance. These conventions are codified as the Rails API (the application programming interface, or directives that control the code). The Rails API is documented online and described in books, articles, and blog posts. Learning Rails means learning how to use the Rails conventions and its API. Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server.</p>
